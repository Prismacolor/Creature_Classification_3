# Creature_Classification_3
This is a "round two" of a previous project where I created a list of fantasy creatures and used classification algorithms from 
scikit-learn to make predictions. I revamped my original data creation script and added some basic Tableau visualizations, as Tableau
is my latest obssession. For the machine learning scripts I used Gaussian Bayes which performed around 97% accuracy on my test sets, 
and I used Decison Trees and a Random Forest, both of which resulted in a 99% accuracy score. The Random Forest did slightly better than
the Decision Tree but the difference is really neglible. After rerunning the machine learning scripts I loaded the training set into 
Tableau and messed around with different combinations of features just to see what would shake out and if I could identify any trends. If 
you saw the previous project, you may know that I attempted to do a clustering algorithm on my data but it didn't pan out so well. You 
can see in one of the visualizations that the clusters are a little more distince, however because of the overlap between certain data 
points, there is still not a lot of clear separation between each class of creature. It was fun to poke around in Tableau though and try 
to get a sense for what it's capable of doing. I am currently taking a course on Pluralsight for Tableau so I wanted to experiment 
with some of the things I learned. I did somehow manage to build my first dashboard with an image, woot woot! Super excited about that. 
Anyway feel free to poke around with the data, and clone it and try out other classification algorithms if you want! This was really just 
meant to be a fun, lighthearted project dealing with a relatively simple, mid-sized data set. Enjoy!
